1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- When I initialize a repository a hidden folder is created called ".git"

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The working directory holdes the original files. the staging area only list the files you wante to commit to the repositry. It is a kinde of "system cache" whiche helpss you to organise your work in to logical parts.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- You can manualy put one file by another in to this stage area. it is like a bag you pack for a travel. only this files you have in it go with you. ;)
