1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- When I initialize a repository a hidden folder is created called ".git"

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The working directory holdes the original files. the staging area only list the files you wante to commit to the repositry. It is a kinde of "system cache" whiche helpss you to organise your work in to logical parts.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- You can manualy put one file by another in to this stage area. it is like a bag you pack for a travel. only this files you have in it go with you. ;)

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- If you wante to do some experimental stuf you can easyli make a new branch, make your changes and if it doesent work nothing is lost, you can easily go back to your normal or master brunche.
- Also you may have mor then 1 branche which helps you to work on some functions at the same time or eaven in team without disturing eachother.
